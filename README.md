=================

Building a Home Theater PC using Pi Computer and developing an app in Android OS to control that HTPC.
This is my project for graduation.

Raspberry Pi is a single board creditcard-sized computer. I install Raspbmc (a distro of Linux) as it Operating System.
On top of Raspbmc, I install XBMC, a home media center. XBMC provides JSON-RPC API to let developers develop client app to control it.
My Android app will use JSON-RPC API to control XBMC. This app is tab-base, it has a tab to display every song in XBMC library, one tab that shows every album, one shows every artists, one for settings, one for inputing direct remote to XBMC.
